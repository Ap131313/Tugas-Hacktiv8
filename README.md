Prompting Strategy via IBM Granite 

You are a frontend developer assistant.
Your task is to generate a complete HTML/CSS/JavaScript codebase for a responsive web app called **Daily Mood Tracker**.

Requirements:
- Input form with:
  - Dropdown for mood (üòä Happy, üòê Neutral, üò¢ Sad, üò† Angry, üò∞ Anxious, üò¥ Tired)
  - Textarea for optional notes
- Two tabs:
  - Log Mood (form input)
  - Mood History (display all previous entries)
- Use localStorage to store and persist mood entries
- Full CRUD:
  - Create: Submit form to save entry
  - Read: View entries in "Mood History"
  - Update: Edit entry, prefill form, resubmit
  - Delete: Show custom confirmation modal before deletion
- Responsive UI (mobile-first):
  - Use flexbox/grid layouts, media queries
  - Avoid elements overflowing on small screens
- Good UX:
  - Highlight active tab
  - Reset form after submit
